## Cookie Consent Banner

The cookie consent banner is loaded only on public pages for visitors on the
live site who have not previously granted consent.

- **Environment**: Rendered only when `NODE_ENV` is `production` or the
  request's hostname matches one in `NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`.
- **Routes**: Admin surfaces such as `/admin`, `/wp-admin`, `/dashboard` and
  `/backend` never load the banner. You can override the prefixes via
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ROUTE_PREFIXES`.
- **Admin Users**: Authenticated admins (detected via a valid
  `admin-session` cookie) never see the banner, even on public routes.
- **Consent State**: If a `cookieyes-consent`/`cky-consent` cookie is present,
  the banner is skipped on subsequent visits.

Configure the domains and prefixes in `.env.local` using the variables shown in
`env.example`. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIEYES_SCRIPT_URL` is not set, the banner is
disabled.
