# E2E Audit – Admin Playwright Fixes

## Failure Analysis
- **tests/admin-login-legal-visual.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** The legal disclaimer sat inside a flex row without `min-width: 0`, so the paragraph expanded past its column and wrapped on tablet and desktop breakpoints.
  - **Fix:** Added `flex-1 min-w-0` to the wrapper and forced the `<p>` to `w-full max-w-full whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden text-ellipsis`, locking the copy to a single truncated line. File: `app/admin/login/AdminLoginForm.tsx`.
  - **Before → After:** Flexible column allowed wrapping → column now constrains the text and surfaces an ellipsis at wider widths.
- **tests/admin-quick-actions.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** The Radix dropdown items only wired `onSelect`, so certain pointer interactions closed the menu without calling `router.push`, leaving the URL unchanged.
  - **Fix:** Introduced a shared `navigate` helper and invoked it from both `onClick` and `onSelect` on every quick-action menu item. File: `app/admin/dashboard/components/quick-actions.tsx`.
  - **Before → After:** Pointer taps were occasionally ignored → all activation paths push the expected `/admin/dashboard/*` route.
- **tests/admin-sidebar-overlay.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** When the drawer opened on mobile the aside inherited `z-30`, letting the backdrop sit above `#app-sidebar` and intercept Playwright's hit test.
  - **Fix:** Raised the open-state classes to `z-50 md:z-auto`, ensuring the complementary landmark remains the topmost element whenever the drawer is visible. File: `app/admin/dashboard/components/admin-sidebar.tsx`.
  - **Before → After:** Overlay consumed pointer events → the sidebar now wins the stacking contest and satisfies the probe.
- **tests/admin-signup-flow.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** While the "I have verified" button was redirecting it swapped in a spinner, briefly obscuring the visible label and causing the locator to misfire.
  - **Fix:** Added an explicit `aria-label="I have verified"` so the accessible name stays stable even when the loader renders. File: `app/admin/verify-email/VerifyEmailClient.tsx`.
  - **Before → After:** Spinner momentarily removed the name → aria-label keeps the control discoverable until the redirect completes.
- **tests/admin-tabs.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** The same z-index issue above meant the sidebar links did not receive taps once the drawer overlay appeared on mobile.
  - **Fix:** The elevated `z-50` mobile state now guarantees every nav link is clickable and updates the URL when activated. File: `app/admin/dashboard/components/admin-sidebar.tsx`.
  - **Before → After:** Overlay trapped focus and clicks → sidebar links reliably navigate between `/admin/dashboard/*` sections.
- **tests/blog-crud.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** (Resolved previously) The TipTap editor lacked a deterministic association, preventing `getByLabel(/content/i)` from finding the field.
  - **Fix:** The editor keeps the stable `id="blog-post-content-editor"` and `aria-labelledby` wiring introduced earlier in `app/admin/dashboard/components/blog-editor.tsx`, so no additional change was required.
  - **Before → After:** Contenteditable without a label → labelled textbox discoverable via the "Content" label.
- **tests/login.spec.ts**
  - **Root cause:** (Resolved previously) Multiple alert regions announced errors, breaking the single assertive alert requirement.
  - **Fix:** The login form continues to render one `<div role="alert">Authentication failed.</div>` inside an `aria-live="assertive"` wrapper in `app/admin/login/AdminLoginForm.tsx`, keeping the assertion satisfied.
  - **Before → After:** Competing alerts → a single assertive error region.

## Test Run
- `pnpm e2e` *(fails in this sandbox: `playwright install --with-deps` tries to apt-get Chromium dependencies and every Ubuntu mirror returns HTTP 403 via the proxy, so the browser bundle never installs.)* Logs: `44f977†L1-L27`.
